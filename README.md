I am in love with solve business problems and by technology, in this way I decided to become a Data Scientist to find insights and create models that can help companies to grow more. 

In this way I'm studying data science with courses of SQL, Machine Learning, Python and much more that can help me to learn more and more hard skills.

With all of that, I developed this skills at this moment:

**Analytical Tools:**

* **Data Collect and Storage Modeling:** MySQL.
* **Data Manipulation and Data Integration:** Python, Pandas and ETL.
* **Static and Exploratory Data Analytics:** Numpy, Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib.
* **Data Preparation and Feature Selection:** Scikit-learn and Boruta.
* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression and Time Series.
* **Data Visualization and Deploy:** Streamlit, Power BI, Flask and Telegram Bot.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Sales Regression - Regression Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Rossmann-Regression)
  * Business Question: How much will be the revenues of each storage?
  * Resolution: was decided to apply algorithm of regression to predict how much will be the revenues of each storage of Rossmann. The algorithm selected was the XGBoost that was capable to predict the max value of sales and the minimum helping the CEO to make choices about the stock, marketing and people of each storage and saving some money.

### [Blocker Fraud Classification - Classification Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Block-Fraud-Classification)
  * Business Question: how detect the frauds transactions?
  * Resolution: to solve the question was used machine learning modeling with some classification algorithm capable to detect if the transaction is fraud or no, the selected was the Random Forest Algorithm demonstrated accuracy of 99%.

### [House Prices Analytics - Analytics Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Houses-Prices-Analysis)
  * Business Question: which houses to buy, when how to sell and when?
  * Resolution: this project found the best opportunities to buy by classifying the houses in bad, good, great and excellent opportunities and when is the best moment to buy between the four seasons of the year to indicate to the CEO.
