I am in love with solve business problems and by technology, in this way I decided to become a Data Scientist to find insights and create models that can help companies to grow more. 

In this way I'm studying data science with courses of SQL, Machine Learning, Python and much more that can help me to learn more and more hard skills.

With all of that, I developed this skills at this moment:

**Data Science Tools:**

* **Data Collect and Storage Modeling:** SQL and WebScraping.
* **Data Manipulation and Data Integration:** Python, Pandas, Koalas and PySpark.
* **Static and Exploratory Data Analytics:** Numpy, Plotly.Express, Seaborn and Pyplot.
* **Data Preparation and Feature Selection:** Scalers, Boruta, RFE, Random Forest and Manual.
* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Regressão, Classificação, Multiclass and Timeseries.
* **Data Visualization and Deploy:** Streamlit. Power BI and Heroku.

## Data Science Projects:

 ### [Health-Car Cross Sell - Ranking To Learn Problem (BEST PROJECT)](https://github.com/Valcilio/Insurance-Cross-Sell)
  * Business Question: Which are the best customers to be considered and how many of them should actually be included?
  * Resolution: In this project a model was built with a Top K Score of around 80% capable of ranking the customers and then the cumulative gains curve was used to indicate how many of them should be approached according to the selected test data, obtaining some insights which can contribute to the business..

 ### [Netflix Multiclass Rating - Multiclass Classification Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Netflix-Multiclass-Rating)
  * Business Question: Who will be the rating of the shows?
  * Resolution: In this case was decided to apply a algorithm to make a predict about the rating of the shows from netflix and the algorithm selected had about 40% of f1-score because the dataset is very little to makes a good predict, then the principal results from this project was the six insights derivated and the next steps suggested, but the notebook is very rich in information.

### [Rossmann Sales Regression - Temporal Regression Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Rossmann-Regression)
  * Business Question: How much will be the revenues of each storage?
  * Resolution: Was decided to apply algorithm of regression to predict how much will be the revenues of each storage of Rossmann. The algorithm selected was the XGBoost that was capable to predict the max value of sales and the minimum helping the CEO to make choices about the stock, marketing and people of each storage and saving some money.

### [Blocker Fraud Classification - Binary Classification Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Block-Fraud-Classification)
  * Business Question: How detect the frauds transactions?
  * Resolution: To solve the question was used machine learning modeling with some classification algorithm capable to detect if the transaction is fraud or no, the selected was the Random Forest Algorithm demonstrated accuracy of 99%.
  * Repository: https://github.com/Valcilio/Block-Fraud-Classification
 
  ### [Slips In & Out Predict - Regression Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Slips-In-Out-Predict)
  * Business Question: How much time will be take to the slips to be joined in and how much to be out?
  * Resolution: Was decided to apply algorithms of regression to predict how much time is needed to the slips be joined in & out and after create a web application with the model producted (the model had a MAPE of 0,03%) and help the business people to help help them to make their own predictions.

### [House Prices Analytics - Analytics Problem](https://github.com/Valcilio/Houses-Prices-Analysis)
  * Business Question: Which houses to buy, when how to sell and when?
  * Resolution: This project found the best opportunities to buy by classifying the houses in bad, good, great and excellent opportunities and when is the best moment to buy between the four seasons of the year to indicate to the CEO. Besides that was found the values to sales this houses before the bought.
